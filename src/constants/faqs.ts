  {
    q: 'How is sponsorship value calculated?',
    a: 'The OX-Collective Valuator uses an 8-step methodology: per-asset valuation based on CPM and exposure time, market adjustment via DMA multipliers, and a Signal Boost\u2122 premium based on 5 data-inferred signals (demand, maturity, exclusivity, depth, amplification).',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is Signal Boost\u2122?',
    a: 'Signal Boost\u2122 is a data-inferred premium multiplier (0.85x to 1.45x) that reads factual signals from your event data \u2014 fill rate, edition history, sponsor count, asset depth, and media amplification \u2014 to determine if your inventory commands a premium or discount. No subjective scoring.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is IQI (Impression Quality Index)?',
    a: 'IQI measures how many times higher quality your event impressions are compared to the digital standard. Digital ads count as "viewed" at 50 milliseconds. Event exposures last 30 seconds to 10+ minutes. IQI = average exposure seconds \u00F7 0.05.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is CPHA (Cost Per Hour of Attention)?',
    a: 'CPHA is Onxite\u2019s canonical metric: Sponsorship Investment \u00F7 Total Attention Hours. It measures what you pay for each hour of focused, multi-sensory human attention \u2014 unlike CPM, which was built for 1.7-second digital impressions.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the SEE \u2192 ENGAGE \u2192 TRY \u2192 ACT framework?',
    a: 'Every sponsorship asset has one primary purpose. SEE = passive visibility (banners, signage). ENGAGE = active interaction (photo ops, games). TRY = product trial (sampling, demos). ACT = measurable action (lead capture, sales). Higher purposes command higher CPMs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this valuation accurate?',
    a: 'This is a directional estimate \u2014 a projected valuation based on industry benchmarks and the Onxite methodology. It represents what your inventory should deliver. To validate, run the activation through Onxite\u2019s measurement platform.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are event impressions more valuable than digital ads?',
    a: 'Digital display ads get an average of 1.7 seconds of attention per impression. Event activations deliver minutes of voluntary, multi-sensory, undivided attention. That\u2019s not just more attention \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamentally different quality.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What\u2019s the difference between Unplugged and Plugged value?',
    a: 'Unplugged = on-site, analog, experiential assets measured with Onxite\u2019s attention-weighted methodology. Plugged = connected media (social, digital, broadcast) measured with standard CPM. The Unplugged methodology is Onxite\u2019s differentiation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do DMA multipliers work?',
    a: 'Major media markets command higher CPMs. An activation in New York (1.50x) is worth more than the same activation in a smaller market (1.00x). The calculator adjusts automatically based on your market selection.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is OX-Collective?',
    a: 'OX-Collective is the premium consulting arm of Onxite. We help properties value, package, and sell sponsorship inventory \u2014 and help brands evaluate and negotiate sponsorship opportunities. This calculator uses the same methodology we use with Fortune 500 clients.',
